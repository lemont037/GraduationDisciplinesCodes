Organization
============

This repository is organized by Disciplines and Classes's days.
So, for exemple, at the folder:

                                     //TechniquesProgramming-I/21.02

you will find the codes developed at the discipline _Techniques of
Programming I_, on the class date _February 21st_.

**Note:** inside of each discipline folder, there is a folder call _Works_,
with all the evaluative works developed on their respective Discipline.
